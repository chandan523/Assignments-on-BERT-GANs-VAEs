Here, the main objective is to create a system with the BERT model for classifying SMS
messages as spam or non-spam to enhance potential security. First, reproduce the results. Then,
enhance the 'epochs = 20' in the 'Training the model' and other relevant sections. Now, let us
know your observations. Do you see any improvements in the prediction accuracy?

# Access the codes on GANs 

Plot the generated image at 4000 epoch. Let us know your following observations: Can we
generate the same quality of the input MNIST image? Will the discriminator be fooled by this
image quality?
MNIST dataset descriptions: The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000
testing images of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset is present in Keras; you do not have to
upload it externally while doing this assignment.

# Access the codes on VAEs

First, reproduce the results for 100 epochs. Then reduce the epoch value to 50. State your
following observations:

(i) Do you observe any change in the training results according to their values in latent space
vectors in comparison to the results obtained in 100 epochs?

(ii) Do you observe any change in the scatter plot of training data on the basis of their values of
corresponding latent dimensions generated from the encoder in comparison to the results
obtained in 100 epochs?
